# Brief

**Purpose:** The purpose of this challenge is to showcase your coding proficiency and demonstrate your approach to code structure, standards, styling, and associated tooling. We encourage you to construct a React Web application that exemplifies your skills in these areas.

Use npm with webpack / any other packager you are comfortable with as we are looking for your React skills as well as coding quality.We suggest using CRA (Create React App) as your baseline web application.

## Application details:

At a high level your application will fetch a list of StackOverflow users and display the list on the screen.

- It must compile without errors - if there are any potential compilation issues highlight them in your documentation.
- When the app is launched, the user should be able to see a list of the top 20 StackOverflow users.
- Each list item should contain user's profile image, name and reputation
- If the server is unavailable (e.g. offline), the user should see a list of empty states with an error message.
- Have cells be expandable (upon tapping the cell), with additional options to 'follow' and 'block' a user
- Follow/block functionality should just be locally simulated, i.e. no actual API call should be made. The meaning of following and blocking is explained in the points below
- Users that are followed should show an indicator in the main part of the list item
- Users that are blocked should show in a disabled greyed-out list item; tapping on the item should not open the details view
- Include the 'unfollow' option in the view when a user is followed
- Write unit tests wherever you see fit
- Emphasize testing and architecture
- Written in either Javascript or Typescript (preferred)
- It should be designed such that the code can bridge to Native
- Explain in a few sentences the design decisions you took developing the above app, and describe anything that you were unable to do due to the time constraint

## Key Requirements:

Your solution must meet the following requirements:

- A readme.md in the root of the project with clear instructions on installing and running the application.
- Use react 17 >
- Provide some baseline unit tests
- Any additional documentation where you believe is required for the application.
- If your project is web-based, please ensure that it is responsive
- Please indicate roughly how much time you spent on this challenge in the following categories: (this doesnâ€™t have to be accurate, rough estimations are fine)
  - Review
  - Design
  - Implementation
  - Testing
  - Documentation

Optional Bonus Points

- Generated JSDocument using your favorite documentation tool.
- Add filtering / search input that filters the list of results from the API call.
- Implement a caching strategy.
- Add paging

## Other Information:

The API call for your user data is:

- GET: http://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/users?pagesize=20&order=desc&sort=reputation&site=stackoverflow
- You are free to use any UX libraries you are most comfortable with as this will afford you the opportunity to best display your styling-fu.
- You are free to use any storage mechanism you are familiar with.
- It is advised you spend 2 - 3 hours on this take home test, however there is no specific time limit, we just ask that you provide us with a good overview of your skills and abilities within the allocated time period provided. You will have 5 days from receipt of this challenge to submit your response.

Please share your response by sending the GitHub repo link to the email zepz_engineering_hiring@zepz.io. If you don't have a GitHub repo you can create one (also free). The sooner you submit this the sooner we can review it and get back to you about the next steps.
